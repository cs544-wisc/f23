# P1 (6% of grade): Counting Loans with Dockerized Shell Script

## Overview

In this project, you'll setup your programming environment for the
first part of the semester (virtual machine, Docker).  You'll practice
writing some shell commands to download a zipped file and search
(grep) through its contents.  You'll automate these steps with a shell
script.  The shell script may depend on other programs (like `unzip`),
so you'll deploy it as a Docker image with the necessary installs.

Learning objectives:
* deploy a virtual machine in the cloud
* follow a complicated series of steps to install Docker
* write a shell script to automate several bash commands
* bundle a shell script up as a Docker image/container

Before starting, please review the [general project directions](../projects.md).

## Corrections/Clarifications

* Sept 7: Link to walkthrough + GCP clarification

## Part 1: Virtual Machine Setup

We'll use Google's Cloud (GCP) for our virtual machines.  They've
generously given each 544 student $100 in credits, which should last
the whole semester if you stick to the [budget
plan](https://github.com/cs544-wisc/f23/blob/main/projects.md#compute-setup).

You can obtain the credits here: https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/374194/pages/google-credits.

Setup a virtual machine that you'll use for the first few projects
(we'll eventually delete it and create a more powerful one for some of
the later projects).

You should have some experience in creating VMs in a prior course (320
or 400), so these directions will be brief, and you can decide things
like what geographic region to create it in (I picked Iowa since it's
nearby), but here are some highlights:

* you can launch and see VMs from here: https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances
* Be sure to choose e2-small for machine type. 
* Update your boot disk settings to  use the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS public image -- select the x86/64 version (**not Arm64**) — with a boot disk size of 25 GB. Once you select these settings, the monthly estimate should be about $14.73 for the VM (if it’s not, you probably selected something wrong, and might run out of free credits before the end of the semester).
* you may have modified firewall settings for other courses, but that's not necessary for 544
* you'll need to setup an SSH key so you can connect from your laptop: https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/metadata?tab=sshkeys (the browser-based SSH client won't work for what we need to do in this class)

Here is a wonderful walkthrough written by Marrisa, one of the peer mentors, on how to properly setup your VM: [https://github.com/Marissa-working/peer-mentor-fall23-cs544/blob/main/p1/instance.md](https://github.com/Marissa-working/peer-mentor-fall23-cs544/blob/main/p1/instance.md). 

When you're done, check that you have the correct Operating System and
CPU with `cat /etc/os-release` and `lscpu`.  Save the outputs to hand in too:

```
cat /etc/os-release > os.txt
lscpu > cpu.txt
```

## Part 2: Docker Install

Carefully follow the directions here to install Docker 24.0.5 on your virtual machine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

Notes:
* there are several different approaches described under "Installation methods".  Use the directions under "Install using the apt repository".  Make sure you don't keep going after you reach "Install from a package"
* the first step under "Install Docker Engine" has two options: "Latest" or "Specific version".  Choose **"Specific version"**
* we'll use version `5:24.0.5-1~ubuntu.22.04~jammy` -- be sure to modify the `VERSION_STRING` accordingly!

To avoid needing to run every Docker command with root, there are a
few more steps you can do here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user
(don't go beyond the "Manage Docker as a non-root user" section).

Create some more files so we can check your Docker install:

```
docker version > docker.txt
docker compose version > compose.txt
```

## Part 3: Shell Script

This zip file contains a CSV file with data about loan applications in
WI: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~harter/cs544/data/hdma-wi-2021.zip.

Try running some shell commands to download the zip, extract the
contents, and count how many lines contain the text "Multifamily" (case sensitive).

Now, combine these commands in a `count.sh` file; the script should
have a shebang line so that when running 
```sh
./count.sh
```
it runs with with `bash`.

## Part 4: Docker Image

Create a `Dockerfile` that starts from a base image of your choosing
and includes your `count.sh` file.  The Dockerfile should do any
installs needed for your script to run.

You should be able to create an image and container like this:

```
docker build . -t p1
docker run p1
```

It's OK if there's extra output besides the actual count.

## Submission

At a minimum, your submission repo (watch for an announcement on how
to set this up) should contain the following: `os.txt`, `cpu.txt`,
`docker.txt`, `compose.txt`, `count.sh`, `Dockerfile`.

If you worked with a partner, there should only be one submission
repo, with at least one commit by each partner.

## Tester

Copy `autograde.py` and `../tester.py` to your working directory 
then run `python3 autograde.py` to test your work and environment setup.
The test result will be written to a `test.json` file in your directory. 
This will probably be your grade, but autograders are imperfect, so we
reserve the right to deduct further points.  Some cases are when
students achieve the correct output by hardcoding, or not using an
approach we specifically requested.
